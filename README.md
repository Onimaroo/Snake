# Snake
A snake game written in Python which the graphical interface is supported by upemtk, a library given by my university. Made during my freshman year. 

## How do I execute the game?
You just have to execute the Snake.py script file. Once executed, you have to make a choice of the game version you wanna play. Input 1 in the command line to play the normal game, 2 to play the toric version (no boundaries).

## Presentation
You control a snake who has to eat apples to increase your score and the more apple you eat, the faster you will move. You must avoid colliding your face either with your own body or with the boundaries of the stage (except in the toric version) as it means instant death.

## How to play?
Like the real snake, the game is mechanically simple. Press the directional arrows to move in a direction and press Spacebar to pause the game.
